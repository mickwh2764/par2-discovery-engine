SECTION 1: METHODS - WHY AR(2) NOT AR(1)
=============================================================================

RESEARCHER: Thomas Höfer (DKFZ Heidelberg)
PAPER: Kuchen et al. eLife 2020 - "Hidden long-range memories of growth and 
       cycle speed correlate cell cycles in lineage trees"
DOI: 10.7554/eLife.51002

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
"The choice of second-order autoregressive modeling [AR(2)] over first-order 
[AR(1)] is not merely a statistical convenience but reflects biological 
reality. Höfer and colleagues demonstrated that while mother-daughter cell 
cycle correlations are weak (r ≈ 0.1-0.2), cousin cells sharing a common 
grandmother show surprisingly strong correlated cell-cycle durations 
(r ≈ 0.3-0.4) [Kuchen et al., 2020]. This 'skip-generation' memory pattern 
is precisely what AR(2) captures through its β₂ coefficient, which quantifies 
the influence of the t-2 observation. The eigenvalue modulus |λ| derived from 
AR(2) thus reflects biologically validated multi-generational dynamics that 
AR(1) would systematically underestimate."

SECTION 2: DISCUSSION - MOLECULAR BASIS FOR CLOCK→TARGET HIERARCHY
=============================================================================

RESEARCHER: Wendy Hwang-Verslues (Academia Sinica, Taiwan)
PAPER: Scientific Reports 2023 - "Core clock gene BMAL1 and RNA-binding 
       protein MEX3A collaboratively regulate Lgr5 expression"
DOI: 10.1038/s41598-023-44997-5

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
"The eigenvalue hierarchy we observe—where clock genes consistently show 
higher temporal persistence than proliferation targets—has a recently 
elucidated molecular basis. Hwang-Verslues and colleagues demonstrated that 
BMAL1 directly activates transcription of MEX3A, an RNA-binding protein that 
binds and stabilizes Lgr5 mRNA [Hwang-Verslues et al., 2023]. This creates a 
regulatory cascade (BMAL1 → MEX3A → Lgr5) where clock gene dynamics 
necessarily precede and constrain target gene expression. The higher 
eigenvalue of clock genes reflects their position as upstream regulators in 
this hierarchy."

SECTION 3: INTRODUCTION - THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
=============================================================================

RESEARCHER: Bogi Andersen (UC Irvine)
PAPER: Stem Cells 2023 Review - Circadian clock in epithelial stem cells
CONTEXT: Theoretical integration of circadian control with stem cell function

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
"The constraints-before-mechanism framework adopted here aligns with 
Andersen's theoretical synthesis of why circadian clocks regulate adult 
epithelial stem cells [Andersen et al., 2023]. The clock's primary role, 
Andersen argues, is to coordinate the cell cycle with intermediary metabolism 
to minimize DNA damage—creating an 'optimal window' for replication that 
maximizes genomic integrity. Our eigenvalue-based approach quantifies this 
coordination: high clock eigenvalues reflect stable temporal gating, while 
elevated target eigenvalues suggest escape from circadian constraint."

SECTION 4: DISCUSSION - EPIGENETIC MEMORY AND GENERATIONAL PERSISTENCE
=============================================================================

RESEARCHERS: William Faubion & Brooke Druliner (Mayo Clinic)
PAPER: bioRxiv 2025 preprint - "Intestinal Stem Cells Retain an Epigenetic 
       Memory of Inflammation"

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
"The persistence of eigenvalue patterns across conditions may reflect 
epigenetic memory mechanisms recently documented by Faubion, Druliner, and 
colleagues [Hamdan et al., 2025]. They demonstrated that intestinal stem 
cells from previously inflamed tissue retain altered chromatin accessibility 
even after months in culture without inflammatory signals—a 'primed' state 
that affects subsequent responses. This suggests that eigenvalue signatures 
may capture not just instantaneous dynamics but inherited epigenetic states 
that persist across cell generations."

SECTION 5: RESULTS - AGING AND TISSUE-SPECIFIC PATTERNS
=============================================================================

RESEARCHER: Salvador Aznar-Benitah (IRB Barcelona)
PAPER: Solanas et al. Cell 2017 - "Aged Stem Cells Reprogram Their Daily 
       Rhythmic Functions to Adapt to Stress"
DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.035
DATASET: GSE84521 (analyzed in this study)

RECOMMENDED TEXT:
"Our AR(2) analysis of epidermal stem cell data from Aznar-Benitah's 
laboratory [Solanas et al., 2017; GSE84521] reveals tissue-specific aging 
patterns. In epidermal stem cells, mean eigenvalue decreases with age 
(adult: |λ|=0.824, aged: |λ|=0.754), opposite to the pancreatic pattern. 
Caloric restriction partially preserves higher eigenvalues in aged tissue 
(|λ|=0.808 vs 0.754 in controls), consistent with their findings that CR 
prevents circadian reprogramming. This tissue specificity underscores that 
aging is not a uniform eigenvalue shift but a tissue-dependent trajectory."
