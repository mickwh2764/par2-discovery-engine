  "AR(2)": "Autoregressive model of order 2 — predicts a value from its two previous time points, measuring how much 'memory' the system has.",
  "eigenvalue": "A number showing how strongly a signal persists over time. Higher = longer-lasting, lower = fades quickly.",
  "|λ|": "The eigenvalue modulus — how persistent the signal is. Near 1 = barely decays. Near 0 = fades quickly.",
  "eigenvalue modulus": "How persistent the signal is. Near 1 = barely decays. Near 0 = fades quickly.",
  "clock gene": "A gene driving the body's ~24-hour clock (e.g. PER2, BMAL1). These genes oscillate rhythmically every day.",
  "target gene": "A gene controlled by clock genes — for example, genes managing cell division or metabolism.",
  "FDR": "False Discovery Rate — adjusts for testing many genes at once so you don't get false positives.",
  "p-value": "How likely this result is due to chance. Smaller = more significant. Below 0.05 is usually considered meaningful.",
  "stationarity": "The signal's pattern stays consistent over time — it isn't drifting up or down.",
  "root-space": "A 2D map placing each gene by its AR(2) coefficients. Position reveals whether behaviour is oscillatory, decaying, or persistent.",
  "bootstrap": "A reliability check: re-analyse random subsets of the data many times to see how stable the results are.",
  "permutation test": "A significance test: shuffle the data randomly many times to check if the real result is stronger than chance.",
  "circadian": "Relating to biological rhythms with a ~24-hour cycle, driven by the body's internal clock.",
  "chronotherapy": "Timing drug treatments to match the body clock for better effectiveness or fewer side effects.",
  "Granger causality": "Does knowing gene A's past help predict gene B's future, beyond gene B's own history?",
  "ODE": "Ordinary Differential Equation — a math model describing how quantities change continuously over time.",
  "AIC": "Akaike Information Criterion — balances model accuracy vs complexity. Lower = better model.",
  "BIC": "Bayesian Information Criterion — like AIC but penalises complexity more. Lower = better model.",
  "Cohen's d": "Effect size — how big the difference between two groups is, measured in standard deviations.",
  "persistence hierarchy": "Clock genes consistently show stronger persistence (higher eigenvalues) than the target genes they regulate.",
  "phi1": "The first AR(2) coefficient (β₁) — how much the previous time point influences the current one.",
  "phi2": "The second AR(2) coefficient (β₂) — how much the time point two steps back influences the current one.",
  "R²": "R-squared — the fraction of variation explained by the model. 1.0 = perfect fit, 0.0 = no fit at all.",
  "R-squared": "The fraction of variation explained by the model. 1.0 = perfect fit, 0.0 = no fit at all.",
  "Ljung-Box": "A test checking if the model captured all the patterns. PASS = good fit (residuals are random noise).",
  "residuals": "The leftover differences between the model's predictions and the actual data. Should look like random noise if the model fits well.",
  "ACF": "Autocorrelation Function — checks if leftover patterns remain at different time lags. Bars inside the dashed lines = good.",
  "state space": "A plot of the two AR(2) coefficients (β₁, β₂) showing where each signal falls in terms of dynamic behaviour.",
  "stability": "Whether a signal stays bounded (stable) or grows without limit (unstable). Stable signals have eigenvalues below 1.",
  "gearbox": "The 'gearbox hypothesis' — clock genes act as a persistent driver, while target genes respond with lower persistence, creating a hierarchy.",
  "time series": "A sequence of measurements taken at regular intervals over time — like gene expression measured every 4 hours.",
  "confidence score": "A 0–100 rating of how trustworthy the analysis result is, based on multiple quality checks.",
  "implied period": "If the signal oscillates, this estimates the cycle length in time units (e.g. ~24 for a circadian rhythm).",
  "white noise": "Random fluctuations with no pattern — what good residuals should look like after the model removes the signal.",
