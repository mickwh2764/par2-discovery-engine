                    and least persistent signals — a kind of "dynamic range" of your body's timing signatures.

                  The wearable engine takes a CSV of time-stamped physiological data, resamples it to hourly averages,
                  and fits an AR(2) autoregressive model. From this model it extracts the eigenvalue modulus |λ|,
                  which measures how persistently the signal repeats its pattern from one time step to the next.

                  For multi-day recordings, this captures <strong>circadian persistence</strong> — whether your
                  body's daily rhythm repeats consistently. For shorter recordings, it measures
                  within-session temporal regularity, which is a different (less informative) thing.
